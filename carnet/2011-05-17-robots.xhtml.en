<p>Man created robots to his image, but was extremely disappointed. Yet, hope was nurturing imaginations<!-- this one from arkhi! -->. As in every mythology, He invented Genesis, the ultimate moment of the before-and-after. Our short lives demand that this instant be short so that one can feel it during one's lifetime. Be it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(film)">Ghost In The Shell</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)">I, Robot</a>, <a href="http://www.wetherobots.com">We the robots</a> (below), robots are awakening to conscience, the ultimate gift.</p>

<p>As a generality, man disappears or gives a place in society to this new sentient species. But is this the whole story? Are there other paths that we don't consider, subtler paths? I turn to my computer for answers.</p>

<div class="sourcecode">

<p>Hmm… who is answering? A program, reacting to instructions built into the Unix system of my computer. This is not a proper answer but a programme for my future. The program was designed to answer in the future. When we type <code>whoami</code> (&lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo;), the program gives us our login name on the computer. Although the answer is correct and in accordance with what was defined, it shows a lack of &lsquo;conscience&rsquo;. Let's imagine the program replied &lsquo;I don't know&rsquo;. All of a sudden the relationship becomes more interesting: it is an accident, a chance to explore, to better understand. It's the beginning of a dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="leprogrammeduquotidien">Daily programming</h2>

<h3 id="calendrier">Calendar</h3>

<p>Our lives are full of those moments when we respond to programmes. The calendar reorganises time in a sequence of weeks, months and years. But even more than that, it is scheduling our future. We obey to elements that structure our individual actions, but also, unconsciously, our social behaviours. In numerous parts of our industrialised society, we have set a rhythm of 5+2 days. Those two weekend days program a different behaviour, a type of action, a destruction of our flexibility. In bigger companies, we <em>generally</em> cannot go to work on Saturday instead of Wednesday, because it is not inside the programme. Accident was made impossible.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/2011/05/17/calendrier" alt="" /><br/><span class="source">Calendar for May 2011</span></p>

<h3 id="systmedecartographie">Mapping system</h3>

<p>Online mapping systems also provide a programme whose influence we hardly realise. Looking for directions from a starting point to a destination has become a banal action. We don't really think about it. We're not amazed any more. The program is usually optimised according to some criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>distance (the shortests), </li>
<li>time (the shortest), </li>
<li>journey (the cheapest), </li>
<li>means of transportation: walking, by car, public transport (with a date and hour).</li>
</ul>

<p>These choices reflect a certain organisation in our societies, in its values and optimisation. The path suggested is always the same for the above criteria. We just need to follow instructions to make a quantum leap between the two landmarks. The in-between is of no importance, it's only the execution that matters. We could even optimise this quantum leap a bit more by completely <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-google-driverless-cars-legal-nevada.html">automating the ride, directly plugged into the online directions system</a>. The reason for it will be security and system optimisation. Once everyone is plugged into the same system, we can also regulate, distribute traffic throughout different paths.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/2011/05/17/directionmap" alt="Direction map"/><br/><span class="source">the road to Renault, Cléon at Elbeuf (France)</span></p>

<h3 id="laroute">The road</h3>

<p>The mapping system is itself programmed through another programme: the system of roadmaps. Before the invention of roads and machines, we walked with a broad flexibility. Our constraints were made up by the natural geography of the physical space and by its biology. We have created paths, then roads, then railways, to optimise our movements, to make them safer, more controllable, more efficient. By following them we respond to a preestablished programme, whose existence we hardly question, and from which we can hardly get away.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/2007/10/12-6722-circulation" alt="Concrete road system"/><br/><span class="source">Hong-Kong, 12 October, 2007</span></p>

<h2 id="demeilleursprogrammes">&lsquo;Better&rsquo; programmes</h2>

<p>These programmes are a constraint. For many of them, we don't always realise the impact they have on our free will. We have accepted them. We follow them happily, somehow feeling safe and comfortable, considering they speed up our decision-making in society. Of course they can be optimised.</p>

<p>Mobile devices can track our movements, their frequency. Operators know exactly, give or take a few meters, how much time we spent in a particular place. The matter is not so much about tracking movement as it is about understanding immobile moments, and categorizing them. Our mobile device says that we spent 45 minutes in this japanese cafe at noon. It notices we regularly go there around the same hour several times a week. That we exchange messages with friends who are in the same cafe too at the same instant. All this information could be used to propose an itinerary that not only responds to the former criteria but also to our preferences. The route proposed will adjust itself to use streets with shops that might be of interest for us. The program will suggest a stop at a place we like and avoid places where we don't feel good. This program will eventually be easier to follow because it will be much closer to what is natural to us. It's less violent.</p>

<h2 id="ladsobissancenumrique">Digital disobedience</h2>

<p>Personalisation is a system to program our future.</p>

<p>By reducing the risks of accident, by optimising the experience, we create a life-system that asks less questions. Eli Pariser calls this phenomenon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s">filter bubbles</a>. In our encounter with information, programs progressively eliminate accidental elements, those that are prone to destabilise us, those that we do not want to see. Programs create a more policed universe in which we want to <a href="http://www.recombinantrecords.net/docs/2009-05-Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death.html">take part until our end</a>.</p>

<p>The system is pernicious because it does not feel like a real constraint, it makes us used to our initial choices up to a point where we're not even aware of these choices any more. <strong>We are the robots.</strong></p>

<p>In the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-e" title="WALL-E - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Wall-e</a>, the robot introduces the accident into the heart of humans that are not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9s7afoYI-M">aware of their state</a>. The self-guided chairs stop, obese humans must walk and talk. They have to talk again. They realise they have a swimming pool. Humans had forgotten they had a conscience.</p>

<p>In all these systems that surround us, we must sometimes create digital disobedience in order to create new possible pathways.</p>
